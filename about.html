            <p>Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood DBE RDI (née Swire; born 8 April 1941) is an English
                 fashion designer and businesswoman, 
                largely responsible for bringing modern punk and new wave fashions into the mainstream</p>
            <p>Westwood came to public notice when she made clothes for the boutique 
                that she and Malcolm McLaren ran on King's Road, which became known as SEX. 
                Their ability to synthesise clothing and music shaped the 1970s UK punk scene which was dominated by McLaren's band, the Sex Pistols.
                She viewed punk as a way of "seeing if one could put a spoke in the system".</p>

      <h1 class="2-heading"><span class="text-primary">Life and Career</span> </h1>
      <p>Westwood was born in the village of Tintwistle, Cheshire, on 8 April 1941, as the daughter of Gordon Swire and Dora Swire (née Ball),
        who had married two years previously, two weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War. At the time of Vivienne's birth, her father was employed as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory; he had previously 
       worked as a greengrocer.</p>
   <p>In 1958, her family moved to Harrow, Middlesex, and Westwood
    took a jewellery and silversmith course at the University of Westminster, then known as the Harrow Art School, but left after one term, saying:
    "I didn't know how a working-class girl like me could possibly make a living in the art world". After taking up a job in a factory and studying at a teacher-training college, 
   she became a primary-school teacher. During this period, she created her own jewellery, which she sold at a stall on Portobello Road.</p>
